Here's some stuff about Frozen</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">
With $750 million after two weeks of global release, Disney's animated blockbuster Frozen 2 should top $900+ million in worldwide receipts next weekend, to continue Disney's domination of the box office. At this rate, the film should pass $1 billion the following weekend to give the Mouse House its sixth billion-plus earner this year. </p>

 More about Frozen</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">
Through yesterday, Frozen 2 had an estimated $765+/- million in theatrical receipts.

Frozen 2 currently sits in the #9 spot on 2019’s worldwide box office charts, but will rise to at least #6 before it leaves theaters, giving Disney’s family of studios six of the year’s top seven highest grossing movies. the other film being Spider-Man: Far From Home, which was made by Disney-Marvel for Sony. And of course, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker hits theaters later this month and will certainly enter the “Billion Dollar Club,” meaning eight of the year’s 10 highest grossers were produced by Disney (and seven of the top eight grossers — and remember, the non-Disney film of the top eight is the Disney-Marvel created Far From Home).</p>

 EVEN more</h2>
 <p style="font-family:verdana;">
 Which means, as I reported back in August, Disney will top $11 billion in global box office receipts this year. That’s not just a new all-time box office record, it’s a roughly 45% increase over the previous annual box office record for any studio (set by Disney in 2016, with $7.6 billion). It’s doubtful any studio will come close to topping that record any time soon, since this year was especially loaded with a huge slate of major branded IP from Disney (partially as a plan to ensure a large number of recent popular releases will be available quickly on the new streaming service Disney+).

Disney’s worldwide domination is mirrored by the studio’s domestic performance, where their films will finish the year north of $4+ billion and firmly in control of most spots on the box office top-10 list.
